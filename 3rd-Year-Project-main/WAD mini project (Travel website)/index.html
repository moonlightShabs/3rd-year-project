        <h1 class="title text-start">Maldives</h1> 
        <p class="h5 pt-4">A Tropical Paradise</p>
        <p>Maldives is a tropical paradise of 1192 islands, grouped into 26 coral atolls, in the Indian Ocean. The islands are the remnants of ancient volcanic mountains, surrounded by crystal clear lagoons and coral reefs.Maldives has a rich and diverse culture, influenced by its location along the ancient trade routes and its Islamic faith.</p>
        <p class="h5">Resorts for Everyone</p>
        <p>Every resort in Maldives is its own private island, and with over 100 to choose from the only problem is selecting where you want to stay. At the top end, the world’s most exclusive hotel brands compete with each other to attain ever-greater heights of luxury, from personal butlers and private lap pools to in-room massages and pillow menus. It’s not surprising that honeymooners and those seeking a glamorous tropical getaway have long had the country at the very top of their wish lists. But there’s also plenty of choice beyond the five- and six-star resorts.</p>
        <p class="h5">Unbelievable Beaches</p>
        <p>Maldives is home to perhaps the best beaches in the world; they’re on almost every one of the country’s nearly 1200 islands and are so consistently perfect that it’s hard not to become blasé about them. While some beaches may boast softer granules than others, the basic fact remains: you won't find consistently whiter-than-white powder sand and luminous cyan-blue water like this anywhere else on earth. This fact alone is enough to bring well over a million people a year to this tiny, remote Indian Ocean paradise.</p>
        <p class="h5">Independent Travel</p>
        <p>Maldives has undergone seismic change in the past 10 years, since inhabited islands have been opened to tourism and locals permitted to build their own guesthouses. Travelers no longer have to stay in resorts and remain separate from the local population, something that kept backpackers away for decades. Island hopping by public ferry, speedboat and domestic flights has opened up this incredible country to visitors on almost all budgets. A number of islands in Male and Ari atolls are now big centers for a booming guesthouse industry, with dozens of options on each.</p>
        <p class="h5">Underwater World</p>
        <p>With some of the best diving and snorkeling in the world, the clear waters of Maldives are a magnet for anyone with an interest in marine life. The richness and variety is astonishing; dazzling coral walls, magnificent caves and schools of brightly colored tropical fish await you when you get down to the reef. In deeper waters lurk manta rays, turtles, sharks and even the world’s largest fish, the whale shark. The best bit? The water is so warm many people don’t even wear a wetsuit.</p>

Fantastic trip for the price we payed.

When we ran into some problems with one of the excursion companies and we requested a refund, they worked hard to get us part of our money back and also booked another excursion for the one we missed. They are a great company! Highly recommend booking your vacation through them!🏝️
